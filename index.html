        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a
        year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world
        of known physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
        the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in
        the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
        repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
        instant.
      </p>

      <p>
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
        not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
        Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>

      <p>
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
      </p>

      <p>
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big
        Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYc9YmKIO8&amp;feature=youtu.be">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
        with telescopes at the South Pole, a
        team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in
        the fabric of space-time — so-called <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html">gravitational
          waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently
        apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
        smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it
        could ever be proved.
      </p>

      <p>
        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark
        energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and
        energy to science and speculation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
        hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
        and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
        bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
